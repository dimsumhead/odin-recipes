    <h2>Kimchi-jjigae (김치찌개) or kimchi stew is a jjigae, or stew-like Korean dish, made with kimchi and other ingredients, such as pork or seafood, scallions, onions, and diced <em>dubu</em>or tofu.</h2>

    <p>Kimchi's flavor as an ingredient becomes stronger and more complex as it ages. As a result, kimchi jjigae is often cooked using older, more fermented, and "riper" kimchi, which has a much more pronounced flavor and contains higher amounts of probiotics. (Living bacteria in fresh, uncooked kimchi will not survive the cooking process.) As kimchi is the core ingredient in kimchi jjigae, other ingredients are dependent on personal preference.</p>
    <p>Sliced kimchi is put into a pot with the meat of choice and other typical ingredients such as tofu, sliced spring onions, and garlic. They are stewed in water or anchovy (myeolchi) stock. The stew is seasoned with fermented bean paste (doenjang) or fermented red pepper paste (gochujang).</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
        <li>1 onion <em>(thinly sliced)</em></li>

        <li>3 cups chicken stock <em>700ml, can substitute fish or beef stock)</em></li>
