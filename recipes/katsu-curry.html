    <h1>Japanese Curry with Chicken or Pork Cutlet</h1>
      <img src="../img/katsu-curry.jpg" alt="rice, chicken cutlet and curry sauce in a plate">
    <h2>Katsu curry, also known as Katsukare in Japan, is one of the most popular dishes in the country's cuisine. It has become a favorite amongst the Japanese people to cook at home. Nothing says comfort food like a crispy yet juicy chicken or pork cutlet with flavorful curry sauce, over a bed of warm, steaming white rice.</h2>
    <p>There are several components to a great katsu curry, which include your rice, your pork, your brine, your breading, and the curry itself. Each component requires its own ingredients, which all come together harmoniously to produce this delightful dish.</p>
    <p>Japanese curry is quite different in flavour and consistency from other authentic curries. The sauce is thicker than other curries in the world. It is similar to the consistency of béchamel sauce, and it is delicious. Katsu curry is the best dish to enjoy after a long day!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>400g onions sliced into 1cm wide pieces</li>
        <li>250g potatoes cut into 1.5cm cubes</li>
        <li>100g carrots sliced to 7mm thick pieces</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>1/2 packet of 230g House Vermont Curry (you can choose whichever curry roux brand you like)</li>
        <li>800ml water</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked rice (hot)</li>
        <li>4 Chicken Cutlets cut into 2.5cm wide strips (you can also use Pork cutlets)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Add oil to a pot and heat over medium high heat.</li>
        <li>Add onion and sauté for a few minutes or until the onion becomes translucent and edges start getting slightly burnt.</li>
        <li>Add potatoes and carrots into the pot and stir for a couple of minutes or until the surface of the vegetables starts getting cooked.</li>
        <li>Add water and turn the heat up to bring it to a boil. Then reduce the heat to medium low and simmer for about 7 minutes or until the vegetables are nearly cooked through (note 4).</li>
        <li>Break the curry roux cake into small blocks along the lines and add them into the pot. Stir gently to blend the curry roux.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, place a lid on and cook for about 10 minutes or until the curry roux is completely dissolved. Stir occasionally as the curry tends to stick to the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li>Check the consistency of the sauce. It should be like béchamel sauce. If it's too thick, adjust with some water. If too thin, cook further without the lid. It will thicken when cooled down as well.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat off.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Serving</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a cup of hot cooked rice onto one side of a plate. Place the chicken cutlet pieces next to the rice, leaning them on the rice so that there will be a space to pour the curry.</li>
        <li>Pour curry next to the chicken cutlet.</li>
    </ol>
